## What is irqbalance

Irqbalance is a daemon to help balance the cpu load generated by interrupts across all of a systems cpus. Irqbalance identifies the highest volume interrupt sources, and isolates them to a single unique cpu, so that load is spread as much as possible over an entire processor set, while minimizing cache miss rates for irq handlers.

## Dockerfile

[**Trusted Build**](https://hub.docker.com/r/uzyexe/irqbalance/)

This Docker image is based on the official [debian:jessie](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/) base image.

## How do I install `irqbalance` with this?

If you want to install `irqbalance` into `/usr/local/bin`, just do this:

    docker run --rm -v /usr/local/bin:/target uzyexe/irqbalance

The `uzyexe/balance` container will detect that `/target` is a
mountpoint, and it will copy the `irqbalance` binary into it.

If you don't trust me, and prefer to extract the `irqbalance` binary,
rather than allowing my container to potentially wreak havoc into
your system's `$PATH`, you can also do this:

    docker run --rm uzyexe/irqbalance cat /irqbalance > /tmp/irqbalance && chmod +x /tmp/irqbalance

Then do whatever you want with the binary in `/tmp/irqbalance`.
